## 🍪 Using Cookies (Optional)

To download videos that require authentication (e.g., private or regional content)

simply place a `cookies.txt` file inside the `cookies` directory:

```bash
cookies/
  └── cookies.txt
```

### How to Get Your Cookies

#### The cookies.txt file must be in Netscape HTTP Cookie File format

Use the [Get cookies.txt LOCALLY](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc?utm_source=item-share-cb) browser extension:

1. Log in to the site (e.g., YouTube)
2. Click the extension and export as `cookies.txt`
3. Place it into the `cookies` folder

MEDIS will automatically use it during downloads

> ⚠️ Keep your cookies file secure. It may contain sensitive login data

## 📦 Manual Update [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds) to Nightly Version

Sometimes, `yt-dlp` may stop working or have trouble downloading videos. If this happens, you can easily update it to the **nightly** version from inside the Docker container to get the latest fixes and improvements.

### 🔄 Manual Update Steps

1. **Ensure the `medis` container is running**
   Check with:

   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

2. **Run the update command to switch to the nightly build:**

   ```bash
   docker exec medis yt-dlp --update-to nightly
   ```

3. **Restart the `medis` container** to apply the update:

   ```bash
   docker restart medis
   ```

### 🧠 Notes

* This update will **remain active until the container is removed or rebuilt**
* For long-term stability, consider updating the Docker image to include the latest version of `yt-dlp`
